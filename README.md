# Loan_Disbursement_Analysis

## Introduction

This project provides a detailed analysis of loan distribution over the past six months, focusing on key metrics and performance indicators. It includes an overview of monthly disbursements in EUR to capture trends and cash flow, as well as disbursements by loan officers to assess individual impact and efficiency. Additionally, it examines the volume of loans disbursed, highlighting any notable patterns. A critical component is the portfolio-at-risk analysis, where KPIs help identify areas of financial exposure, including assessing risk in loan portfolios with potential repayment issues. The report also flags incomplete loan data, addressing invalid loans caused by inconsistent data, with the goal of enhancing data quality and compliance for future disbursement activities.
